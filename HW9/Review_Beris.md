The new plot definetly improved on ambiguity. In the original plot it was imposible to gain information
from any of the comparisons. In the new plot it is much easier to understand what each little box is
showing. The new plot improved on the distraction as well, the point of the plot is very clear and 
easy to understand, which was to see the correlation between the gene expression data. I do not think
that there is any distortion in the new plot, especially with using the diverging colormap.
One potential issue with that color map though, is that if someone has color blindedness that causes them
to only see in grayscale, it would be hard to see the difference between the negative and positive values
in the heat map.

I think that the new plot does a good job of respecting Tuft's 5 rules. I think that the new plot
did an excellent job of improving on all of Tuft's 5 rules.The only thing I would maybe change is 
that the plot does show the same information twice as it is mirrored over the diagonal, so I would maybe 
leave one side of the diagonal blank in order to avoid redundancy in communication. 

Bad Plot from Literature:

In the bad plot that you found from literature, it is hard to understand what they are trying to show
us with it. I agree that if it showed some sort of change over time it would make a lot more sense.
