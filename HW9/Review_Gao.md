The new plot looks clear a lot! The ambiguity absolutly decrease a lot. It basically impossible to read any information from old one.
Although there is no tick in the new plot, it is impossible to read the tick in old plot as well. Also, new plot do a good job
in decrease the distortion. From the old plot, it is hard to see any detail in any single cell of plot. And new plot remove
the tick and cell line reduce the distraction.

For the 5 rules, I think the new plot made improvement in second and third rule. I don't think both plot has problem in color choosing, and the new plot absolutly is more clear in color.
In general, I think you did a good job in improving this figure. One thing this figure could be improved depends the purpose of this figure.
If there is any cell you think is important, you could only label that part of axis.

And this is the bad plot you got in journal. It shows a huge ambiguity. Too many spectrum overlap with each other, which makes
this figure hard to see the trend between different time. This is the one that should use small multiples. It is a time series comparison
and it contains two many data in a single plot.

For the color, it may not be a big problem if the spectrum plot in different plots. The color selection is good. The only problem is there are two many
line in same figure, thus it may looks messy, but it is not the fault of color.
