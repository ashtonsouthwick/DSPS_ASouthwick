Data Science for Physical Scientists

I am taking this course because I am interested into going down the data science/analysis route for my career, so I figured this would be a useful step down that path

I hope to learn how to think like a data scientist, and get better at analyzing and interpreting data

The majority of the research I have done uses python, so I have a lot of experience using python for data analysis, which should definitely help me.
