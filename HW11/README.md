# New Plot:

This updated plot is much better. Switching from the overplotted scatterplot to dashed lines reduced ambiguity and distorition, making the plot much easier to read. Moving away from the log x axis and changing the axes labels also helps with ambiguity and makes the plot easier to interpret. The viridis colormap makes it color-blind compliant, which is also very good. In terms of Tufte's rules, the changes made improve the overall quality of the plot. Switching from the log x axis  improved the effect size because the visual spacing of the lines is now more proportional to the numerical spacing in the data. Replacing the dense scatterplot to the dotted lines increases the data/ink ratio. This also helps with the no chart junk rule, as overlapping points and  inconsistent colors were removed. Overall, the improvements make the plot much more cleaner and aligned with Tufte's rules.


# Bad Plot from Literature:

This plot has a very large amount of information, and is overly dense and cluttered, which makes it quite hard to interpret. The figure has too many arrows, text blocks, labels, overlapping colors and datapoints, background shadings, and has too many comparisons (densities, temperatures, flux, planet categories etc).

This updated plot is definitely an improvement of the original. The gridlines help with readability, and the use of colorblind friendly colors also improves readability for colorblind people. Scaling down the markersize reduces readability, and the legend is cleaner and easier to read.
In terms of Tufte's rules, the updated plot better satisfies several of them. Shrinking down the marker sizes and choosing the colorblind friendly set of colors increases the data/ink ratio. The removal of large datapoints also reduces chart junk. The gridlines also makes it easier to interpret the plot. The updated plot avoids redundant encoding by only using colors to differentiate filters and nothing else, although the original plot did this, the updated plot maintains avoiding the redundant coding, which is a plus. The plot also maintains a lie factor ~ 1. Overall this is a good improvement.

# Bad Plot From Literature:
<img width="565" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1f3989e-7707-4d9d-bba9-6bac6f1a1050" />
This plot tries to show too many things in one plot. The Rayleigh scatter vs. pumping energy is already difficult to interpret due to the y axis being compressed and the datapoints being too clustered. Putting an illustration of the actual experiment in the same plot causes severe clutter. 
In terms of Tufte's rules this figure violates several of them. Overlaying the entire experiment lowers the data/ink ratio. There is a lot of chart junk due to the decorative shapes, colors, and arrows. The lie factor is inflated due to the experiment shown in the plot because it distorts the relative scaling of the plot. This also violates the avoiding reduncancy rule, as multiple kinds of information in the form of data, experiment layout, labels, etc. are all in the same gracph even though they represent different things. Overall this plot has a lot of ambiguity and distraction and unnecessary visual density.
